    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog presents `LeafSim`, an example-based **explainable AI** (**XAI**) technique for decision tree based ensemble methods.<br/>\n",
    "The process applies the Hamming distance on leaf indices to measure similarity between instances in the test and training set.<br/>\n",
    "It therefore explains model predictions by identifying training data points that most influenced a given prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed technique is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- easy to interpret by non-technical people\n",
    "- complementing existing XAI techniques\n",
    "- straightforward to implement & maintain in production\n",
    "- computationally lightweight"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post will explore example-based XAI techniques. As such, the article will introduce an approach that aims to complement well-established techniques, such as [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).<br/>\n",
    "Specifically, the approach aims at explaining individual predictions of decision tree based ensemble methods, such as [Catboost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost), regardless of whether they are regressors or classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing XAI approaches, such as SHAP, provide insights into the most relevant features, both from a global and local perspective. In addition, they can provide perspective to predictions of individual data points, such as measuring how model predictions differ with varying feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for people with limited knowledge in Machine Learning, it can be less intuitive to parse such information and build an understanding of what underpins model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, providing example-based explanations can be very helpful, as we outline in this blog post."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we addressed the interpretability gap of popular XAI techniques, such as SHAP and Lime, regarding their use by people with limited knowledge in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, an example-based approach to explain decision-tree based ensemble methods was proposed, identifying the most relevant instances in the training set on which the model bases a particular prediction.\n",
    "This measure of relevance is expressed using the `LeafSim` score, which captures how often observations end up in the same leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly through a qualitative assessment of selected examples, we demonstrated that the `LeafSim` score indeed reflects similarity between observations.<br/>\n",
    "Furthermore, the model tends to predict observations with higher LeafSim scores more accurately.<br/>\n",
    "Therefore, end-users can use such scores to adjust their confidence in model predictions."

    "The [Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)](https://datascience.ch/) is a joint venture between EPFL and ETH Zurich. Its mission is to accelerate the adoption of data science and machine learning techniques within academic disciplines of the ETH domain, the Swiss academic community at large, and the industrial sector. In particular, it addresses the gap between those who create data, those who develop data analytics and systems, and those who could potentially extract value from it. The center comprises a multi-disciplinary team of data and computer scientists as well as experts in selected domains with offices in Zürich, Lausanne, and Villigen.<br/>www.datascience.ch\n"

    "Each tree has the same weight in `LeafSim`, which may not be the most faithful approach depending on the Machine Learning method we would like to explain.<br/>\n",
